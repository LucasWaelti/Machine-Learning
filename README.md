# Machine-Learning
A few Python source codes about machine learning and neural networks. 

## NeuraNetwork.py

This python script creates an entire Neural Network (completely customisable through inputs when creating an instance of the class). 
All is needed is the training data and then the code takes over by training the network until a desired precision is reached. 

**There is no external library envolved!!** Everything was coded without any external help other than already existing python libraries.
